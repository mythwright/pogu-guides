# Recording with NVidia Shadowplay

> You must have a NVIDIA compatible GPU

1. Download Nvidia GeForce Experience from https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/
2. May have to create an account with Nvidia before starting.
3. Then Download the latest and greatest GPU driver for your card.
4. In the top right of the application open the settings tab.
5. Make sure your "In-Game Overlay" is in status "Ready"
6. Turn on "In-Game Overlay" default key bind is  ALT+Z
7. In the overlay there are 3 options. You can Set up instant replay, Straight record the whole gameplay, or Live stream it to your favorite streaming platform. etc. Twitch, YouTube.
8. Different ways to record your gameplay.
    - The easiest is just record the whole gameplay but it will take up the most memory. Just press record when you want to record and turn it off when finished.
    - Instant replay, which is my favorite. It lets you turn on instant replay, which can record anything back up to 20 minutes. So its always on but not constantly saving the recording. It will only save it when you tell it to save it. Default key bind is listed in key bind settings for shadow play overlay.
    - The Live stream is exactly what is sounds like, You set up your favorite streaming platform to live stream your game too. This is the most computer demanding but in most cases you wont have to use up your memory to save the videos.
9. Lastly the videos will be saved into your default video files unless you setup a different play for them to save to. "This PC -> Videos -> ("Name of game played")" "Ex. C:\Users\branm\Videos\Guild Wars 2"
10. You then can play the video with anything that plays a .mp4 file. default is windows media player.
11. Then you can upload it to your favorite platform to send to the guild chat or friends etc. Easiest to use is Youtube.com and upload the video then copy and paste the shareable link in ‚Å†video-review channel.
